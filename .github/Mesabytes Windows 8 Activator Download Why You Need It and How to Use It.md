## What is Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator?
 
Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator is a software that allegedly can bypass the activation process of Windows 8 and make it appear as if it is genuine. It does this by using a technique called KMS (Key Management Service) emulation, which mimics the communication between a KMS server and a client computer. KMS is a legitimate feature of Windows that allows organizations to activate multiple devices with a single key. However, some hackers have exploited this feature to create fake KMS servers that can activate any device without a valid key.
 
Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator is one of the many KMS-based tools that are available on the internet. It claims to be able to activate any edition of Windows 8, including Pro, Enterprise, and RT. It also claims to be compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. To use it, you need to download it from a website (such as [^4^]) and run it as an administrator. Then, you need to click on the "Activate" button and wait for the process to complete. After that, you should be able to use Windows 8 without any restrictions.
 
## How does Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator work?
 
Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator works by injecting a DLL file into the system registry. This file contains the code that emulates the KMS server and responds to the activation requests from Windows. The file also modifies some system files and settings to make Windows think that it is activated by a genuine KMS server. The activation lasts for 180 days, after which it needs to be renewed by running the tool again.
 
## What are the risks of using Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator?
 
While Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator may seem like an easy and convenient way to activate Windows 8 for free, it comes with several risks and disadvantages. Some of them are:
 
- **It is illegal.** Using Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator or any other KMS-based tool violates the terms and conditions of Microsoft. You are essentially using a pirated copy of Windows, which can result in legal consequences if you are caught.
- **It is unsafe.** Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator or any other KMS-based tool can contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You cannot trust the source or the content of these tools, as they are not verified by any authority or antivirus program.
- **It is unreliable.** Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator or any other KMS-based tool can stop working at any time due to updates or changes in the system. You may also experience errors or glitches in your Windows performance or functionality. You may also lose access to some features or services that require genuine activation, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Store, or Microsoft Office.

## What are the alternatives to Mesabytes Windows 8 Activator?
 
The best and safest way to activate Windows 8 is to buy a genuine license key from Microsoft or an authorized retailer. This way, you can enjoy all the benefits and features of Windows without any risk or hassle. You can also get technical support and security updates from Microsoft.
 
If you cannot afford to buy a license key, you can try some other methods that are legal and free. For example, you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free if your device meets the minimum requirements. You can also use some open-source operating systems such as Linux or Ubuntu that are free and compatible with most devices.
